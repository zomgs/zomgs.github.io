Itinerary.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka, previously known as Ceylon and a Portuguese, Dutch and British colony before it fell into the hands of the island’s majority group, the Sinhalese, some 7 decades ago, in 1948. Today the political situation is messy, having recently wrapped up a civil war and with young people emigrating. That said, the tourists come greater by the numbers every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with Sabrina, a digital nomad whom I had traveled with earlier, we ventured to backpack the island for the 30 days stay our visas allowed. Here’s the itinerary!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;airport-to-colombo&quot;&gt;Airport to Colombo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our first stop in Colombo, the capital. Travelers usually skip Colombo in favor of the much smaller, less polluted Negombo that’s been developed more for tourism. Pick up a SIM card from Dialog and Mobitel after arrival. From Bandaranaike, the airport, take the bus or hire a private vehicle. The about 1 hour tuk-tuk ride was LKR 1500. Use PickMe, the Sri Lankan taxi app to get the local fare prices. The bus fare was significantly less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, the capital may have little to offer from a tourist’s point of view, but Negombo is hardly much better with its touts and tourist prices. If time is not critical, a day could easily be spent sightseeing Colombo in a tuk-tuk. $10 and there-about were oft-quoted prices. Additionally, taking the South- and Eastbound train is more convenient from Colombo than Negombo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Colombo, we had arrived amidst a long-standing political debacle. A Prime Minister being unconstitutionally ousted, plots unraveling to have a president assassinated and politicians fist fighting in parliament were stories related to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;cap&quot;&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Buddhism is the dominant relgion on most of the island. Seema Malaka, a small temple in Colombo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;train-from-colombo-to-mirissa&quot;&gt;Train from Colombo to Mirissa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting on the morning train from Colombo was refreshingly straightforward. Show up at Fort Colombo, half an hour before departure and get the desired ticket. Although the official Sri Lanka railway website list only 2nd and 3rd, there is infact an observation deck available for the morning train. albeit at a much elevated price. For our particular Colombo to Mirissa ride, the first class ticket was probably not needed. A similar experience would have been possible in the 2nd class carriages as well. This was not true for our ride from Nuwara Eliya to Kandy, however, where we found ourselves regretting not getting the reserved carriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;cap&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-south-galle-unawatuna-waligama-mirissa-dikwella&quot;&gt;The South; Galle, Unawatuna, Waligama, Mirissa, Dikwella&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many popular destinations are found on the island’s southern parts; the part simply referred to as The South and home to many of the country’s beaches. People interested in snorkeling, surfing, yoga, relaxing and even partying are almost sure to have their needs met her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our own case, we settled at Mirissa Beach which already had a good reputation among travelers we hd met, and bloggers alike. Indeed, we found the location agreeable as well; not just because of the beach’ overall atmosphere but also for its location that allowed for day trips in either direction, towards Galle or Matara and the beaches en route. (insert map).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;cap&quot;&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Popular photo spot in Mirissa&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scooter and other vehicles could be rented for 1000 LKR(less than $6) a day. Riding on the back roads made for scenic and enjoyable experiences while the main roads less so. Always avoid the main roads when you can! (insert road pic)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bus-from-mirissa-to-ella&quot;&gt;Bus from Mirissa to Ella&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no direct bus from Mirissa to Ella. We first  took the bus from Mirissa to Matara bus Station. It left frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Matara, bus 31, 31-1 and 31-2 departed multiple times daily. We took bus 31 to Bandarawela, departing 9:50 in the morning. The ride took about 5 hours and included a midwy break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-highlands-ella-nuwara-eliya-and-kandy&quot;&gt;The Highlands; Ella, Nuwara Eliya and Kandy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;cap&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/lanka/little-adam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/480/little-adam.jpg 480w,    /assets/resized/800/little-adam.jpg 800w, /assets/images/lanka/little-adam.jpg 1000w&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Ella's main attraction, Little Adam's peak&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in Ella, Nuwara Eliya and Kandy. A more popular route is to go in the reverse direction; from Kandy to Ella. That way, the beaches come at the trip’s end. Since we were heading north, that was not an option for us. To be sure, the train ride was interesting. On the leg from Ella to Nuwara Eliya, we run into misty weather, creating sort of a mystical and spooky atmosphere. The weather was brighter on the leg from Nuwara Eliya to Kandy, however. We found the general highland weather to be more volatile than we liked and in spite of us following the weather forecasts, planning sometimes became impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;cap&quot;&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Nine arches bridge, Ella&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these towns hd their own set of peculiarities, but of the three, Ella was most promising, Kandy decidedly most disappointing and Nuwara Eliya something in between. Why Kandy received so much praise, I could not understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usual activities in this area, include the Kandy-to-Ella train ride,(nd the reverse direction) and hiking activities to scenic peaks and sights, in addition to tea plantation visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Taking shelter from the rain that never stopped. also, Hiking on the tracks is a popular activity in Ell.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bus-from-kandy-to-dambulla&quot;&gt;Bus from Kandy to Dambulla.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebakersjourney.com/kandy-dambulla-air-conditioned-bus/&quot;&gt;TheBakersJourney&lt;/a&gt; made a post on how to go about taking the bus from Kandy to Dambulla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Essentially, the Kandy to Dambulla bus leaves several times an hour, including ones with air-conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Show up at the bus station and ask for Dambulla and you’ll be pointed in the right direction. The ride is 2 hours. The air-conditioned bus costs less than 200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;north-central--the-cultural-triangle-dambulla-sigiriya-anaradahapura&quot;&gt;North Central / The cultural triangle, Dambulla, Sigiriya, Anaradahapura.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;cap&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/lanka/stupa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/480/stupa.jpg 480w, /assets/images/lanka/stupa.jpg 800w&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;“Giant&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dambulla, a town with almost nothing, except for maybe the Dambulla Cave tourist trap, was our staging point used to access the peaks in Sigiriya; the iconic Lion Rock and the cheaper Pidurangal. Habarana which is connected by the railway might very well have be a more practical staging point; not only for exploring Sigiriya, but also for other sites on the Cultural Triangle, such as Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the time before European colonization, Sri Lanka had had a life on its own with its own kings and religion, and a civilization capable of leaving architectural remnants behind. Initially intrigued to learn more about the island’s history, the intrigue somewhat faded as it became clear that these sites also act more like tourist traps than places to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and Sigiriya, each came with a $25 entry and would require a guide for it to be truly worthwhile. Little signage, museums not worthy the name and guards repeatedly asking to see your tickets, didn’t help on those feelings. Backpackers on a budget and those conscious of where their money, might find the investment hard to justify. Value had compared to value given doesn’t match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;cap&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/lanka/lion-rock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/480/lion-rock.jpg 480w, /assets/images/lanka/lion-rock.jpg 800w&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;view of Lion Rock, Sigiriya&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My companion pointed out it wouldn’t be right just to rush through the region and skip everything., so in the end, we went with a dumbed down version to our original plans, skipping Polonnaruwa and seeing Sigiriya and Anuradhapura unguided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bus-from-dambulla-to-anuradhapura&quot;&gt;The bus from Dambulla to Anuradhapura.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just show up at the right bus stop and you’ll soon be in your way. Departs frequently. We got on from this stop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;train-from-anuradhapura-to-jaffna&quot;&gt;Train from Anuradhapura to Jaffna&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Anuradhapura, we got on the morning train to Jaffna. Only first-class carriages were available. 1100 LKR. The train from Anuradhapura to Jaffna departs from this station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exploring-jaffna-and-the-north&quot;&gt;Exploring Jaffna and the north&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaffna and the north had been an anticipated highlight since the journey’s beginning. The north is skipped by most travelers who instead choose to more accessible destinations on the island. For us however, it was an exciting opportunity to get off the beaten path and explore the different Hindu dominated side of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;cap&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/lanka/temple-girl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/480/temple-girl.jpg 480w, /assets/images/lanka/temple-girl.jpg 800w&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most of Lanka is inhabited by the Buddhist Sinhalese, the north is mostly populated by the Hindu Tamils. It was in this region much of the civil war took place. In short, the Sri Lankan Tamils endured Sinhalese instigated pogroms that culminated eventually into a grueling and decades-long civil war with casualties reaching a hundred thousand. Today, while the war is over, Tamils continue living a life in oppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaffna and the north was a welcome change and break from touts and the general hustle and bustle further south. While the  infrastructure was less developed, we found an exemplary host in the guest house we chose for our stay. We mostly spent our time exploring the region on a rented scooter. See here for routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bus-from-jaffna-to-kalpitiya&quot;&gt;The bus from Jaffna to Kalpitiya&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We showed up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-western-beaches-kalpitiya&quot;&gt;The western beaches, Kalpitiya.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kalpitiya was an anonymous town with almost nothing in it for the tourists. The surrounding beach areas are popular with the kite surfers however and indeed the region was geared towards watersports and kitesurfing activities. A good range of generally steeper priced accommodations are available. Unless you’re looking to kitesurf or just want to relax, I would question whether coming out here is worth it or not. That said, we came in the off-season and had a relaxing time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;cap&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/lanka/kalpitiya.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;    /assets/resized/480/kalpitiya.jpg 480w, /assets/images/lanka/kalpitiya.jpg 667w&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having come into Colombo on arrival, it made sense to hit up Negombo for our departure. Indeed, Colombo may have had its aforementioned disadvantages, but  Negombo was not without its faults. Apparently, being the start and stop point for the journey of visitors in this country come with a host of consequences. Most annoying perhaps was not being left alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;national-parks&quot;&gt;National parks.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often on our minds as we made our way through the country, was the question of whether to visit any of the national parks; now very popular among the tourists. Elephants &amp;amp; leopards might be their top draws, but there is also other wildlife on offer. We skipped them entirely. Many of the parks are really popular and one should expect polluting jeeps driving in columns, competing for space. If that’s your thing,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, we moved slowly, in a relaxed pace. Had we wanted to and moved faster, more ground could have been covered. For example, we could have aimed for Trincomlee, Batticaloa and Arugam Bay.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Thomas Bye</name></author><category term="Sri Lanka" /><summary type="html">30 days in Lanka.

Value had compared to value given doesn’t match. view of Lion Rock, Sigiriya My companion pointed out it wouldn’t be right just to rush through the region and skip everything., so in the end, we went with a dumbed down version to our original plans, skipping Polonnaruwa and seeing Sigiriya and Anuradhapura unguided. The bus from Dambulla to Anuradhapura. Just show up at the right bus stop and you’ll soon be in your way. Departs frequently. We got on from this stop Train from Anuradhapura to Jaffna From Anuradhapura, we got on the morning train to Jaffna. Only first-class carriages were available. 1100 LKR. The train from Anuradhapura to Jaffna departs from this station. Exploring Jaffna and the north Jaffna and the north had been an anticipated highlight since the journey’s beginning. The north is skipped by most travelers who instead choose to more accessible destinations on the island. For us however, it was an exciting opportunity to get off the beaten path and explore the different Hindu dominated side of the country. While most of Lanka is inhabited by the Buddhist Sinhalese, the north is mostly populated by the Hindu Tamils. It was in this region much of the civil war took place. In short, the Sri Lankan Tamils endured Sinhalese instigated pogroms that culminated eventually into a grueling and decades-long civil war with casualties reaching a hundred thousand. Today, while the war is over, Tamils continue living a life in oppression. Jaffna and the north was a welcome change and break from touts and the general hustle and bustle further south. While the infrastructure was less developed, we found an exemplary host in the guest house we chose for our stay. We mostly spent our time exploring the region on a rented scooter. See here for routes. The bus from Jaffna to Kalpitiya We showed up The western beaches, Kalpitiya. Kalpitiya was an anonymous town with almost nothing in it for the tourists. The surrounding beach areas are popular with the kite surfers however and indeed the region was geared towards watersports and kitesurfing activities. A good range of generally steeper priced accommodations are available. Unless you’re looking to kitesurf or just want to relax, I would question whether coming out here is worth it or not. That said, we came in the off-season and had a relaxing time. Having come into Colombo on arrival, it made sense to hit up Negombo for our departure. Indeed, Colombo may have had its aforementioned disadvantages, but Negombo was not without its faults. Apparently, being the start and stop point for the journey of visitors in this country come with a host of consequences. Most annoying perhaps was not being left alone. National parks. Often on our minds as we made our way through the country, was the question of whether to visit any of the national parks; now very popular among the tourists. Elephants &amp;amp; leopards might be their top draws, but there is also other wildlife on offer. We skipped them entirely. Many of the parks are really popular and one should expect polluting jeeps driving in columns, competing for space. If that’s your thing, Final thoughts. Admittedly, we moved slowly, in a relaxed pace. Had we wanted to and moved faster, more ground could have been covered. For example, we could have aimed for Trincomlee, Batticaloa and Arugam Bay.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">North Kalimantan</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/north-kalimantan" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="North Kalimantan" /><published>2018-08-20T00:00:00+07:00</published><updated>2018-08-20T00:00:00+07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/north-kalimantan</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/north-kalimantan">&lt;p&gt;As much as I enjoyed my time in Kalimantan Timur, the island’s Eastern part, it was time to move on. Locals from whence I came, warned there really weren’t a lot of things going on in the North. Spending a week there, those weren’t entirely unfounded claims. At least from a tourist’s set of eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d made contact with a woman up there, willing to meet and help out during my stay there. She was a history teacher, living in Malinau and working in Setulang village, three-quarters ride away. I was told the salary was substantially better out in the districts. She conceded though, that it was tough working out here on her own and that it did take a toll on her emotionally, but claimed that for her, it was a better choice. It allowed her save up and go on her own travels one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Malinau, I was trying to understand better where the hell I had brought myself. While true that there was a whole lot of nothing in this town, there were discoveries to be made and observations to be had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bunch of missionaries has based themselves at the hotel I was staying at. Christian, white ones. Presumably, they also owned the hotel. Grace hotel was its name. Fitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I could see, they loved being there. Every moment of it. After all, they were out here doing important work. The work of none other than the God almighty himself. Preaching to unsuspecting people the existence of the legendary figure, sending people to heaven or hell, based on how well they behaved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come across these people and their symbols frequently in these parts and they always pause me to think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, in the restaurant, a table of 3 next to me. They’re discussing business. Curious to have a white face in their midst, they invite me to come join them. One has thoroughly mastered the English language, having learnt it from an early age. A privilege that can not be understated. They’re discussing mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon his friends leave and I’m granted an audience with what strikes me as an important man for the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s struck gold, literally. Geologists surveying his land, found it and now he’s working on setting up operations and securing finances, but, it needs to be carried out in secrecy. Mining is political in Kalimantan, as that’s where much power lays and the extension thereof, money. All sorts of shady things happen to make political statements in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gives examples that political entities will sabotage mining operations causing them to leak poison into the rivers, killing downstream marine life and its water drank by people. This, just to create problems for operators somehow working with the wrong side. He brings up Bruno Manser, the Swizz environmentalist who mysteriously disappeared having taunted the Borneo elite for decades. In his view, killed, further making references to The Borneo Case, a documentary putting the spotlight on the crimes committed on this island, where the money went and who was behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part of the world, you’re free to do what you want. Rape, pillage and uproot humans, their communities and culture(let’s make no mention of other fauna(or flora)) at your own peril. Just make sure to pay the right people. Stories most of us won’t hear. Even if we did, it wouldn’t have mattered. The story of a rainforest that overnight became a plantation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Malinau, I’d been invited to attend an event that consisted of a van full of books and children reading from them. The absence of a library, prompted resourceful community members to come up with this initiative in an attempt to inspire and provide young people an opportunity to become familiar with the world of books.

Not long after, I was entering the Indonesian side of the island, Kalimantan. Arriving Pontianak with an aim of backpacking the island in its entirety, I soon discovered that travel here is quite different from that of other destinations in South East Asia(SEA)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-expect-from-kalimantan&quot;&gt;What to expect from Kalimantan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kalimantan is not a typical destination for the backpackers roaming the region. Perhaps for good reasons. The infrastructure having simplified travel in more traditional SEA destinations is yet to be developed here, and, as far as catering to English speaking travelers’ needs go, the industry has improvements to do. With the exception of some official and tour agencies’ websites, information is hard to come by. Add to that a people struggling with said language, with sights few and far between as well as of things to do, poor road conditions, pollution and a scarcity of online accommodations, it becomes clear why it’s not a hot backpacker destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have something to make it worthwhile, though. They have people. Utterly great people who will take you on unforgettable adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the island lends itself as a staging point for adventure travel and getting off the beaten path. A desire for novel experiences, to connect with people, their culture and place in the world ought to be primary reasons for coming here. Kalimantan is also a looking glass into the environmental destruction the world is facing in its quest for resources and profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The island’s greatest asset is its friendly and hospitable people who unlike the Malaysian counterpart have not yet had much exposure to foreign travelers. As such Kalimantan serves as a place for meeting people of different backgrounds, some eager to learn about your world and teach you about theirs. Great place for cultural exchanges, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-backpack-kalimantan&quot;&gt;How to backpack Kalimantan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lesser traveled destination, backpacking this island required some adaptations in how I’d usually done my travels in the region. While hostels are commonly the norm for backpackers in the region, this is less often an option for Kalimantan. Hotels serving mostly a domestic business and tourist audience are widely available, but not ideal for a backpackers wanting to socialize. Thus, one needs to become flexible. In my case, flexible meant turning to Couchsurfing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having tried them both during my Kalimantan stay, the best experiences comes from interacting with the locals. For the uninitiated, the prospect of staying with Couchsurfers could be a daunting one. In hindsight, however, the prospect of having backpacked Kalimantan without their aid would be even more so. True, it is exhausting to immerse oneself to a different culture, but, if easy is your goal you wouldn’t be coming here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d heard of a UNESCO endorsed festival coming up, in the eastern parts of Kalimantan and was on my way there to find out what it was about. Little information was available online, but I had been able to gather it was a week-long festival featuring folk costumes, music, and dances. A true cultural festival and a big one at it, if rumours were to be believed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had noticed through advertising on my flight to Kalimantan that Tenggarong was trying to establish itself as a tourist destination. Having arrived town, it was possible to see how. Although, they appeared to be targeting a domestic audience. A western traveler would probably have found the whole place a little underwhelming. I wasn’t there to be overwhelmed by grandiosity however, I was simply there to attend their festival and get a glimpse into the culture this festival could offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the performances, it was possible to gain an insight into the differing group’s culture. Particularly of interest to me, was how the Western performances compared to the Indonesian ones. A few European groups had ventured all the way to Tenggarong in an attempt to display their culture to the local audience. Even for an individual as uninformed in these matters, the contrasts between the two worlds were noticeable the. While I’m not one to elaborate on the differences, it seemed clear that these worlds were eons apart. Fascinating to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a paled skinned man in these parts, I was sure to draw a lot of attention. Undeservedly, it elevates my status in this society. I’m suddenly an elite member, and, as I’ve come to learn, that brings about certain additional privileges. Elite in this society happen to be those having positions in the government. Or, own a coal mine. During the entirety of the festival, members of the government were given priority seating and had an excellent vantage point on the festivities. The plebs however, were asked to sit elsewhere. Preferably far away. It was interesting to observe how blatant this separation between government and ordinary people was. I was at times appalled due my beliefs in equality. The pale skin gave similar advantages and when asked to join the VIP arena, I wasn’t about to say no. Quite selfish, I know, but what can I do? To change this phenomena? Besides, I wanted to shoot some pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tenggarong, along with Balikapan, was one of the prettier places I visited in Kalimantan. It was noticeable how they’ve been trying to carve out their own place in the world of tourism. It was impressive how the community had been working together to arrange a free festival for everybody to join, or,  as one of their slogans read; “creating something out of nothing”. Indeed they had created something out of nothing.

This time with the intention of spending a couple of nights. As I discovered, this was rather backpacker friendly destination. Maybe not in the traditional sense, but in the sense that there’s an incredibly strong and coordinated Couchsurfing community here, excited to take you in to travel with and show you what they’re about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe not a spectacular city, it was however, one of the prettier I saw backpacking Kalimantan. It was almost as if they cared a little bit more about their environment, at least more so than elsewhere. Pollution was less rampant, traffic less congested and with even a cleaner smell. The architecture was some places a step up from the usual patchwork of brick and concrete buildings erected as soon they could be afforded. Parts of the city could probably be accused of being charming, with a myriad of concept cafes and restos having come up in more popular areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crocodile-zoo&quot;&gt;Crocodile zoo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of sights, there are a few. I checked some of them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A visit to the crocodile zoo, commonly encountered in South-East Asia, I avoid these places like the plague. This time I made an exception, for no reason other than wanting to know how bad it was. The moment I set foot in there, I had my answer. Not only was it bad. It was worse than worst. Since we had already ridden out there, I first found myself accepting a discriminatory foreigner price charged on entry. Verily, it would have brought more pleasure to watch my money burn than paying this insidious foreigner price. Sadly, a common phenomena in these parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A farm with crocs. Hundreds of them. Maybe farm is not the right way to put it. It was more like crappy crocodile village. Some living in crap conditions, others in crappier. On the outside they were serving crocodile delicacies for our consumption. Croco sate, croco rice, croco with whatever you want. I was fed up and wanted to get the hell out of there and that’s what we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bukit-bangkirai&quot;&gt;Bukit bangkirai&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not far away from the zoo, Samboja lodge could be found. An Oranghutan shelter, working to rescue and rehabilitate animals having lost their homes as the habitat they once inhabited disappeared due to the widespread logging. Having previously met and conversed with a member of their team in Bukit bangkirai, there was a desire to visit,  but held back by other engagements, I didn’t get the opportunity to stop by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canopy in Bukit bangkirai was another disappointment. In large due to their charging a stupendous amount for foreigner entry. It’s not that it’s unormal to be charged more as a foreigner, it’s that it ruins the experience. Many I’ve spoken to, accept this kind of treatment, but I’m not sure they fully understand how they’re being treated. Whoever said the world is full of suckers, probably got something right. In any case, it didn’t make me feel very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canopy was a sorry attempt to call themselves a tourist attraction. A staircase leading up the two trees, walk the canopy and look at the view. A view that was utterly unimpressive. I didn’t mention the hour long, ardent roads you’ve to put up with too get here. Why locals bother to come here, will remain a mystery. A big tourist trap as far as I could tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word was out, a festival underway, by the Dayaks, drawing me on road trip to the Kalimantan interiors along with my newfound friends from Samarinda. Name of village Tanjung isuy, right on Borneo’s biggest lakes and a famed home to the native people of Borneo, referred to as the Dayaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six hours of nonstop motorcycle riding on horrendous roads, was needed to get there. Potholes killing vehicles coming in its vicinity, didn’t deter my female travel companions however. Not in the slightest. These Kalimantan women were tougher than nails and more fearless than men. Indeed, they were racing these roads like there wasn’t going to be a tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that day what utterly crushed glutes feel like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I also learn it’s possible to access these villages using river transport. Tt would have made for a more comfortable experience, but what’s adventure without discomfort?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, bikes gave the flexibility to do our own day trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;festival-budaya-in-tanjung-isuyv&quot;&gt;Festival Budaya in Tanjung Isuyv&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The festival itself had attracted many a local as well as visitors from the neighboring population centers, such as Samarinda. As foreigners are concerned, I was the only one there. Unsurprisingly, becoming quite an attraction myself. Indeed, I was informed, my mere presence had added to the festival’s overall glamor and credibility. Me, adding to an event’s success? What a joke. But such becomes the privilege of fair skin and non-black hair in these parts of the world. There is an inexplicable reverence for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The festival, it showcased the cultural elements I’d come for in the first place. Folk costumes, dances, and artwork on display. The onstage performances was a little loud for my liking and could need some improvements for next year. Most importantly, to inform these people they need to be more mindful of their ears. Louder is not better and tinnitus is not cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exploring-surrounding-villages-tanjung-jan-and-pulau-lanting&quot;&gt;Exploring surrounding villages, Tanjung Jan and Pulau Lanting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to attending the festival, we opted to go on side adventures and explore the surrounding areas. The lake complex is home to numerous villages, most of whom are inaccessible by roads and require some kind of water transport. Not yet having found someone to take us on the lake, we explore the existing roads on motorbikes, checking out the villages that were connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was nice to walk in the surroundings and for the most part, the added attention my skin brings is amusing and tolerable, but after a while it risks becoming exhausting. I get the celebrity experience, without being an actual celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, my resourceful travel companions succeeded in finding a boat that could take us on to the lake. A fisherman is willing to take us to Tanjung Jone, a village, as we learn, inhabited by people from the island Sulawesi. An island quite a stretch away from here. I’m told they settled down in this remote place about three generations ago and had survived by the opportunities granted to them by the river and the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking through the village, we come across a woman sitting by her still-to-be erected home. She estimates it will be another 4 years until completion, her husband earning 50 000 rupiah a day fishing. A little less than $4. The villagers help in the construction of her home, but material costs will still need to be accounted for. She explains one-hundred-million rupiah, or about $7000, is needed. For now she resides in a home that’s about to fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Thomas Bye</name></author><category term="Kalimantan" /><summary type="html">Road Trip to Tanjung Isuy Word was out, a festival underway, by the Dayaks, drawing me on road trip to the Kalimantan interiors along with my newfound friends from Samarinda.
